 Articles:
 
 - Fighting memory fragmentation (preallocation + indexed list)
 - Tracking memory consumption
 - Memory handling with entity is pretty neat (VRAM or RAM with indices in entity or model)
 - Precalculating polygon visibility (Polygon codec)
 - Homogenuous clipping
 - Pure C, no C++, no STL
 - How to generate gorgeous videos
 - A summary of all the tools used to generate this great game: objToMD5, PNG assembler, Blender movie generator, polygon codec preprocessor.
 - SIMD, autovectorization
 - disable thumb on arm6, enable on arm7
 - -fsingle-precision-constant ?
 - Make text.c text dissapear with a fading effect.
 
 Ideas:
 
 Use VBO for elements Indices, not only vertexArray
 
 Change ComputeInvModelMatrix to be fast (no need to multiply)
 X - Run game in airport mode.
 Disable PNG compression to get ride of the hasAlpha in the material descriptor
 Try GCC auto-vectorization, if no dice implement SIMD method for NEON cortex in 3GS

 
 
 
 X - Look at m3G object format
 X - Check shader precision, try lowp (10bits [-2,2] range floating point)
 X - Checkout matrix palette to perform vertex skinning on GPU. OES_matrix_palette
 
 X - Fix ghost, no transparency is performed
 X - Fix ghost: Pick enemy
 Fix ghost: Gets longer and accelerate with time.
 
 X - Fix SND: NOT WORKING !!!
 
 */

/*		TODO
	 
 X - Fix textures matrix (/255) in fixed renderer
 Fix shadowMapping Moire pattern (polyOffset)
 More light with ship
 Enable 2d light when bullet is fired, sync intensity with bullet

 Reduce ghost DeltaT, right now it's 2ms but maybe a higher number will do.
 

 Improve bullet drawing GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP instead of INDEXED GL_TRIANGLES

 Remove cos and sin usage in devil, use cos and sin table
 Remove cos and sin usage in ghost
 Change enemy default rotation ( fromAbove rotation can be avoided)
 Change enemy creation to something more generic
 
 X - Screen space coordiante system: Choose something godamnit !!!
 
 
 
 Added new enemy ( small )
 X - Collision detection
 
 Explosion: 
	- pregenerated indices for bullets and fx. 
	- Use a VBO to store indices as they do not change. Reuse them accross bullets and fx.
 
 
 //ghost are full of sin and cos :/ !
 
 Center mine
 X - Make hero bullets longer
 X - Make her bullet "rotate"
 X - Flip explosion texture, to simulate diversity
 Remove on explosion stage.
 Make wave rotate
 Make Particules effects 
	- more diverse ( differents textures) 
	- convert to PVR
	- precalculate texture coordinates
	- make particule go cold red -> yellow
 X - Make smoke effects
 
 
 X Laser, precalculated on spawning. 
 X Add laser impact (3d, not a sprite) Note: Using a few particules worked like a charm
 - Convert laser texture to PVRTC
 - Add laser firing wave (3d, not a sprite) 
 X Add Smoke, move wave around
 - Adjust bullets to change type during travel
 X Adjuct bullet blast to grow and shrink 

 
 
 TODO NEXT:
 
 - Check usage of memcpy usage can be optimized if array is declared const & restrict
   For more about this see: http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/cc_restrict.html
 
 Finish ghost:
	- Acceleration
	X Tail length variation
	X collisions
	X Enemy target picking.
 
 X Add bullets impact particules.
 - Change bullets particules (white)
 - Change explosion particules (yellow)
 X Add color change when enemy is hit.

 TONIGHT
 X Add smoke effect
 X Generate a sweet video
 X Try to not interrupt sound but mix them with openAL with slightly different sounds in order to
 X  avoid and echo effect
 
 - Asses tools usability: 
	- Sound: TwistedWave
	- Explosions: 
		- ParticleIllusions
	    - ParticleIllusions SE
 
 X Convert explosion sprite to PVRTC
 - Convert ghost sprite to PVRTC
 
 X Drop color component from vertex Array for:
	X Ghost
	X Explosion 
 X Have the alpha set in the PNG/PVTRC
 
 - Change explosion to consum less fillrate
 
 
 
 WE, RELEASE:
 
 X Fix sound explosion
 X Ghost auto-aiming
 - Press screen to start.
 X Network stack:
	- Repeat 4 last updates.
 X Generate movie
 
 
 X Raise TTL lance
 X Fix ghost: straight line after a while
 X Fix commands recording
 X Fix collision detection error
 - Arcade look: 
	- Press start to play. 
	- Menu with Screen with start and 
	- Replay. 
	- Game Over
	- Lives remaining
	- Power gauge
 
 
 
 - TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO
 
 X Fix statistic not appearing
 X Test performances on iPod touch
 - Try a bigger level (TENSO with two skyes), assess performances.
 X Fix ghosts
 X Fix enemy appearance (circles)
 - Check diff GHOST_DELTA_T_MS=3 and GHOST_DELTA_T_MS=6

/*
 
 June 19th:
 Redone control, button less interface sucked. 
 
 June 8th:
 Added particules on bullets impacts
 Added enemy flicketing when hit
 
 June 7th:
 Designed a sound system on top of OpenAL. Music is still being handled by the hardware. Sounds effect don't suck up CPU, only bandwidth as they are WAV.
 
 June 6th:
 Redone ghost. Effect is now gorgeous
 
 
 March 18yj:
 
 Finished ghost. Effect sucks elephant balls, need to redo it with aspect non-independant on framerate.
 
 
 March 2th:
 
 Done with particules effects
 
 February:

 
 24th:
 
 - Primary collision detection bullet/enemies ( all enemies are 0.1*0.1 screenSpace box).
 - Incorporated Raph's mine02.obj.md5mesh
 - Explosions (Wave)
 
 23th:
 
 - Finished PVRTC mipmapping (Something is wrong with the fucking mipmappg settings: Resolved !!!, problem was incomplete mipmap sequence)
 - Changed enemy memory allocation model Enemy mem allocation and managment does deal with premature death of an enemy ( gap )
 - Added Enemy precaching by scanning events linked list on scene loading.
 
 
 22th:
 
 Now using FVO. Performance improved on 3GS. Itouch still maxed out at 60 fps.
 
 Clear only Depth buffer instead of both color and depth (glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);)

 
 Switched to GCC 4.2
 Added Thumb2 for ARM7
 
 Remove face culling on map rendition ( all polygons are visibles anyway). Done on fixed and shader renderer.
	glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);
	glCullFace(GL_BACK);

 
 21th:
 
 Finally got delta compression working. Took me a fucking week.
	Compress camera path with:
	- DeltaEncoding using vertices indices
 
 18th:
 
 Working on reducing memory consumption of camera path. It's a B.I.T.C.H .
 
 
 13th:
 
 Reduced size of a vertices by using texture coordinate normalization ( using GL_TEXTURE matrix to perform translation)
 Reduced size of normal and tangent by using vector nomalization
 
 
 12th:
 
 Added two players controls
 Added player inputs
 Added player inputs recording and playback		(Consume 400Kb for 4 minutes of playback)
 Generated a good looking video Dodge2.mov
 
 10th:
 
 Added enemies
 Added events sub-system
 Added players mouvements
 
 
 9th:
 
 MD5 Cache system				( reduce memory footprint, improve loading speed)
 Player movements				Basic, need to be fixed
 Enemy ( Devil )				Garbage, done fast to check poly and fillrate capability: So far so good
 Added music via Queue Audio	No impact on framerate !!! Still 60fps !!!
 
 
 8th:
 
 Moved fog conf to text file.
 Fixed glitches in bullets sprites
 Fixed bullet mouvement, now interpolating
 Added firing flash (effect sucks for now)
 
 */

/*
 January:
 
 Added  precalculated Visibility Set
